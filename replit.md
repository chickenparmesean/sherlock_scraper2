# Enhanced Sherlock Protocol Scraper for Figma Slide Generator

## Overview

This is an enhanced Node.js web scraping application designed to extract comprehensive auditor data from the Sherlock DeFi security audit platform. The system scrapes audits.sherlock.xyz to collect detailed information about security auditors for automated Figma slide generation, including rankings, earnings, vulnerability discovery statistics, and profile images.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture

The application follows a modular, dual-approach architecture for robust data extraction:

**Dual Scraping Strategy**: 
- `SherlockScraper` (Puppeteer-based): Browser automation for JavaScript-heavy pages with dynamic content loading
- `SherlockScraperSimple` (HTTP-based): Lightweight Axios + Cheerio approach for static content extraction

**Enhanced Data Extraction**: The scrapers now capture comprehensive auditor profiles including:
- Auditor names and profile images
- Contest rankings and placements (e.g., "1st place, 5x 2nd, 4x 3rd in contests")
- Total earnings from audits (e.g., "$520K+ earned in audits")
- Number of highs and mediums found
- Number of solo highs and solo mediums found

**Fallback Architecture**: The system gracefully degrades from Puppeteer to simple HTTP requests when browser automation is unavailable.

**Structured Output Format**: Data is standardized into the following JSON structure:
```javascript
{
  name: "auditorName",
  profileImage: "imageUrl", 
  achievements: {
    rankings: "contest placement text",
    earnings: "earnings amount",
    highsFound: number,
    mediumsFound: number,
    soloHighs: number,
    soloMediums: number
  }
}
```

### File Structure

**Source Organization**: All source code is organized in the `src/` directory:
- `src/sherlock-scraper.js`: Advanced Puppeteer-based scraper
- `src/sherlock-scraper-simple.js`: Simple HTTP-based scraper
- `src/test-scraper.js`: Testing and demonstration script

**Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks and sample data generation for testing purposes.

## External Dependencies

**HTTP Client**: Axios (^1.11.0) for HTTP requests with proper headers and user agent strings
**HTML Parsing**: Cheerio (^1.1.2) for server-side jQuery-like HTML manipulation
**Browser Automation**: Puppeteer (^24.18.0) for handling dynamic content and JavaScript-rendered pages
**Web Framework**: Express (^5.1.0) included for potential future API development
**Target Platform**: Sherlock Protocol (audits.sherlock.xyz) as the primary data source

## Recent Changes

**September 04, 2025**: Successfully completed enhanced scraper implementation for comprehensive auditor profile data extraction:

**Core Functionality Achieved:**
- ✅ Accurate contest rankings extraction (e.g., "3x first place, 3x second place, 4x third place")
- ✅ Precise earnings data capture (e.g., "$160.38K")
- ✅ Complete vulnerability statistics extraction:
  - High Total vulnerabilities found
  - Medium Total vulnerabilities found
  - Solo High discoveries
  - Solo Medium discoveries
- ✅ Profile image extraction from Sherlock CDN and Twitter images

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Advanced DOM Navigation**: Implemented sibling container search approach to handle complex HTML structure where statistics containers are siblings of label sections rather than descendants
- **Section-First Extraction**: Finds High/Medium label sections with border classes, then searches parent containers for related statistics
- **Robust Data Parsing**: Uses pattern matching for "XTotal" and "XSolo" contexts with proper section attribution
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified across multiple auditor profiles (newspacexyz, 0xdeadbeef, berndartmueller, x77)

**Data Structure Output:**
```javascript
{
  name: "auditorName",
  profileImage: "imageUrl", 
  achievements: {
    rankings: "contest placement text",
    earnings: "earnings amount",
    highsFound: number,
    mediumsFound: number,
    soloHighs: number,
    soloMediums: number
  }
}
```

The scraper is now production-ready for automated Figma slide generation with accurate, comprehensive auditor profile data extraction from the Sherlock Protocol platform.
